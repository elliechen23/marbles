# Host Marbles Locally:

### <a name="runlocal"></a>Run Marbles
 Finally lets install marble's npm dependencies.

1. Open a command prompt/terminal and navigate to the marbles directory.
1. In the command prompt/terminal type:
	
		> cd marbles
		> npm install gulp -g
		> npm install

1. Next up, pick the command that matches your setup. This will run marbles.

- **Option 1:** :lollipop: If you are using a local network use this command:
	> gulp marbles_local


- **Option 2:** If you are using a bluemix network, use this command:
	> gulp marbles_tls

1. If all goes well you should see this message in the console:

- **Output:**

```

1. Go to your browser at the url specified in the console and login. You do not need to enter a password or change the prefilled username of `admin`.

1. Next the set up panel should pop up. Ideally it will walk itself through the 4 stages of initial setup.
	
	1. Check Configuration Files: The first step was to check your config JSON files for easy to make mistakes. The file that was checked can be found in /config/marbles_local.json.

	1. Enrolling Admin: Next up, we attempted to enroll you as your company's admin. This step contacted your Certificate Authority (CA) and fed it the enrollID and enrollSecret from your creds file.

	1. Finding Chaincode: Now we needed to locate the chaincode on your channel. Your creds file says to check the channel mychannel  for the chaincode named marbles.

	1. Create Assets:- Almost there! As a marbles trading company you may bring new marble owners onboard. These marble owners represent your user base. This step will create the marble owners and 3 marbles per owner.
